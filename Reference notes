Principles of Machine Learning: Python

Introduction to Machine Learning

High Level Process
KDD, CRISP-DM, CCC Big Data Pipeline—attempts to scientifically formalise the process of knowledge discovery.

CCC Big Data Pipeline
  Acquisition/recording
  Extraction/cleaning/annotation (reduce noise and remove unnecessary data)
  Integration/aggregation/representation (setup data in one repository for data mining)
  Analysis/modelling
  Interpretation
  
KDD (Knowledge Discovery and Databases)

Selection
Preprocessing
Transformation
Data mining
Interpretation/evaluation
CRISP-DM: Cross-industry process for data mining(includes business understanding and data understanding, and indication of iterative steps)

Typical process (example)

Define what is to be accomplished
Define constraints
Identify risks
Define how results will be evaluated
Identify sources of data
Data cleaning and transformation
Model building (predictive), some examples:
  Classification: yes/no
  Regression: numerical value
  Clustering: grouping observations
  Recommendation
Policy construction (prescriptive)
Evaluation


Four Vs of big data

Velocity
Variety
Volume
Veracity (how trustworthy some data is)


Overview of Machine Learning with K-Means Classifiers
e.g. f(x) = y, where x is data case, y is the prediction
If we know what y's are when training, those are called labels
Supervised ML—learning using labels (correct answers) - a set of cases are used to train, test and evaluate the model.
Unsupervised ML—explorative output.
